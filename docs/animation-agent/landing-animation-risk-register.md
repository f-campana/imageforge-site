# Landing and Benchmark Animation Risk Register

Date: 2026-02-18
Scope: Landing + benchmark (`/`, `/benchmarks/latest`, `/components/landing/*`, `/components/benchmark/*`)
Status model: Advisory-only (cycle 1)

## Usage

- This register tracks baseline animation risks discovered through static analysis plus runtime viewport/motion verification.
- Every row is advisory in cycle 1, including `critical` severity rows.
- Severity and confidence scoring must follow:
  `/Users/fabiencampana/Documents/imageforge-site/.codex/skills/animation-agent/references/severity-rubric.md`

| `anim-entry-001`     | entry sequencing density                             | high     | 0.9        | Runtime matrix on production server showed `motion-rise` class density averaging `49` nodes per landing cell in default mode (`/tmp/animation-runtime-matrix-prod.json`), driven by shared `MotionWrap` usage across many sections.                   | Stacked first-view reveals can reduce immediate readability and increase perceptual complexity for conversion-critical content. | Cap simultaneous reveals in above-the-fold sections and prioritize immediate static readability path for hero + primary CTA.            | Re-run viewport/motion matrix after tuning; verify hero copy and CTA readability at 320/360/390 without waiting for reveal completion. |
| `anim-overflow-001`  | narrow-viewport horizontal overflow                  | high     | 0.93       | Production runtime checks show root-level horizontal scroll on landing at `320x800` and `360x800` in both motion modes (`scrollWidth: 375`, `innerWidth: 320/360`).                                                                                   | Horizontal page drift creates mobile friction and can obscure animation intent/focus context.                                   | Remove root-level overflow at narrow widths; keep any required overflow contained to local code/table containers only.                  | Validate `documentElement.scrollWidth <= innerWidth` for all matrix cells in default and reduced motion modes.                         |
| `anim-loop-001`      | infinite loop intensity                              | medium   | 0.84       | `/Users/fabiencampana/Documents/imageforge-site/app/globals.css` defines infinite `terminal-caret` animation; runtime confirms loop may appear when terminal timeline progresses.                                                                     | Persistent looped motion near narrative copy can increase distraction for motion-sensitive users.                               | Reduce visual prominence of loop and keep reduced-motion suppression strict.                                                            | Verify cursor behavior at desktop/mobile and assert cursor is hidden in reduced-motion mode across matrix cells.                       |
| `anim-timeline-001`  | timeline complexity and timing                       | medium   | 0.88       | `/Users/fabiencampana/Documents/imageforge-site/components/landing/TerminalDemo.tsx` uses `IntersectionObserver` + multiple timers; runtime shows progression only in `1/12` default landing cells (threshold-dependent).                             | Behavior varies by viewport/initial intersection, creating inconsistent perceived responsiveness.                               | Simplify trigger/timeline logic and define deterministic behavior for first-view and post-scroll states.                                | Check terminal line progression semantics across viewport matrix and confirm expected progression rules are explicit and testable.     |
| `anim-seo-001`       | interaction-gated visibility risk                    | medium   | 0.8        | Terminal narrative line visibility depends on in-view progression; most matrix cells remain in preview state until interaction/scroll changes visibility.                                                                                             | If key claims/links are ever moved into gated animation states, discoverability and parity risk increases.                      | Keep SEO-relevant claims/links immediately present in baseline markup; animation should remain enhancement only.                        | Verify all critical claims/links are available in initial HTML/rendered state without requiring timeline progression.                  |
| `anim-a11y-001`      | reduced-motion parity                                | low      | 0.92       | Runtime matrix confirms reduced mode sets landing and benchmark `motion-rise` count to zero in all reduced cells (`24/24`), aligned with CSS/JS handling in `usePrefersReducedMotion` + `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`.                    | Current parity is good; regression risk remains as new motion paths are introduced.                                             | Keep parity checks mandatory for every new motion path and preserve centralized reduced-motion behavior.                                | Add parity regression checks to future audits; confirm non-essential movement remains suppressed in reduced mode.                      |
| `anim-benchmark-001` | benchmark entry-density spillover (data-rich branch) | medium   | 0.77       | Static review of `/Users/fabiencampana/Documents/imageforge-site/components/benchmark/BenchmarkPageContent.tsx` shows many `MotionWrap` boundaries in data-rich sections; runtime currently exercised fallback branch only (`latest.json` is `null`). | When benchmark data exists, simultaneous reveal density may increase initial cognitive load and paint cost.                     | Define benchmark-specific reveal budget and stagger policy separate from landing hero constraints.                                      | Re-run runtime matrix with non-null benchmark snapshot and measure motion node density + readability on mobile widths.                 |
| `anim-benchmark-002` | benchmark narrow-width interaction friction          | medium   | 0.73       | Benchmark tables/charts use overflow containers in data-rich branch (`overflow-x-auto`), not triggered in current fallback runtime path but present in static code.                                                                                   | Narrow screens may require lateral panning to read metric tables, reducing comprehension speed.                                 | Improve responsive table strategy (stacked key metrics, column priority, or progressive disclosure) before adding more motion emphasis. | Validate data-rich benchmark route at 320-412 widths for readability without required horizontal panning of primary metrics.           |

## Operating Notes

1. Advisory-only behavior means no automatic merge blocking from this register in cycle 1.
2. Fix sequencing should follow:
   1. user-impact blockers
   2. accessibility/safety risks
   3. SEO discoverability risks
   4. performance regression risks
3. Runtime evidence in this cycle was gathered against production server (`next start`) with viewport/motion matrix automation (`/tmp/animation-runtime-matrix-prod.json`, `/tmp/animation-focus-matrix-prod.json`).
4. Benchmark runtime was limited to fallback state because `data/benchmarks/latest.json` is currently `null`; data-rich branch risks are based on static code evidence and marked with lower confidence.
