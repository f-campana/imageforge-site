# Landing and Benchmark Animation Risk Register

Date: 2026-02-18
Scope: Landing + benchmark (`/`, `/benchmarks/latest`, `/components/landing/*`, `/components/benchmark/*`)
Status model: Core safety strict in CI (cycle 5) + advisory style scoring

## Usage

- This register tracks animation risks through static review plus runtime viewport/motion verification.
- Core safety checks are now merge-blocking via the animation safety workflow.
- Remaining style/density findings stay advisory.
- Severity and confidence scoring must follow:

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anim-entry-001`     | landing entry density                       | medium   | 0.90       | Cycle-5 canonical matrix (`.tmp/animation/matrix-canonical.json`, `generatedAt=2026-02-18T23:29:18.250Z`) keeps landing default wrapper average at `49.00`; top sequence timing budget is softened in code.                    | Top-half reveal now feels less abrupt, but route-level wrapper density remains unchanged and still requires discipline.     | Keep landing additions micro-only and reduce non-critical in-view wrappers before any broader choreography expansion.          | Re-run matrix after future tuning; target reduction from `49.00` while preserving nav/hero readability. |
| `anim-overflow-001`  | narrow-viewport root overflow               | low      | 0.97       | Cycle-5 canonical + fixture matrices report `overflowLanding=0` and `overflowBenchmark=0` across all 48 checks per run.                                                                                                        | Root-level horizontal drift remains mitigated.                                                                              | Keep overflow clipping/root containment policy and avoid reintroducing root-level horizontal panning surfaces.                 | Keep `documentElement.scrollWidth <= innerWidth` as a blocking CI assertion.                            |
| `anim-loop-001`      | terminal loop intensity                     | low      | 0.88       | Cycle-4 polish did not change terminal animation model; cursor remains reveal-scoped and suppressed in reduced mode via CSS + JS controls.                                                                                     | Distraction risk remains low.                                                                                               | Preserve current terminal loop constraints and avoid decorative loop expansion.                                                | Verify cursor suppression and reduced-mode behavior in every cycle audit.                               |
| `anim-timeline-001`  | terminal timeline determinism               | low      | 0.86       | Cycle-4 scope intentionally left `TerminalDemo` logic unchanged; prior deterministic preview-first behavior remains active.                                                                                                    | Timeline complexity risk is unchanged and still low/advisory.                                                               | Keep explicit full-output control discoverable; avoid new timeline branches without dedicated audit evidence.                  | Re-check timeline behavior if terminal reveal logic changes in future cycles.                           |
| `anim-seo-001`       | interaction-gated visibility risk           | low      | 0.91       | Cycle-5 landing checks (including target viewport subset) report `heroClaimMissing=0` and `primaryCtaMissing=0` in canonical + fixture runs.                                                                                   | Critical claim and CTA discoverability remain safe under animation behavior.                                                | Keep hero claim/CTA in immediate render path and prevent interaction-gated reveal of core indexable content.                   | Preserve hero claim + primary CTA checks in blocking safety script.                                     |
| `anim-a11y-001`      | reduced-motion parity                       | low      | 0.96       | Cycle-5 matrices report reduced-motion media match `24/24` and reduced wrapper average `0.00` in canonical + fixture runs.                                                                                                     | Reduced-motion parity remains healthy after landing-wide micro-interaction rollout.                                         | Maintain strict `prefersReducedMotion === false` gating in `MotionWrap` and keep CSS reduced-motion overrides intact.          | Keep reduced-mode `motionWrapCount=0` as a blocking CI assertion.                                       |
| `anim-interact-001`  | landing micro-interaction consistency       | low      | 0.87       | Cycle-5 introduces reusable interaction classes (`ui-interact-control`, `ui-interact-link`, `ui-interact-card`, `ui-focus-ring`) in `app/globals.css` and applies them across landing controls, links, and card surfaces.      | Interaction feedback is now more consistent; residual risk is drift if future components skip shared tokens.                | Keep new utility tokens as the default for landing interactions and avoid ad hoc per-component transition styles.              | Include token-usage checks in future landing audits and spot-check keyboard focus parity each cycle.    |
| `anim-benchmark-001` | benchmark entry density (data-rich branch)  | medium   | 0.92       | Cycle-5 fixture matrix (`.tmp/animation/matrix-fixture.json`, `generatedAt=2026-02-18T23:29:59.083Z`) still shows benchmark default wrapper average `6.00` (canonical fallback remains `1.00`).                                | Benchmark remains unchanged in this cycle; existing data-rich entry-density risk profile is stable and still monitored.     | Keep benchmark reveal cadence subtle, avoid additional stagers, and tune only if readability/perf signals regress.             | Track benchmark default wrapper average after each benchmark-layout change.                             |
| `anim-benchmark-002` | benchmark narrow-width interaction friction | low      | 0.93       | Cycle-5 fixture portrait checks keep stable mobile interpretation surfaces in all sampled cells: delta cards `3` and recent cards `2` for each `320/360/375/390/412` viewport in both motion modes; overflow remains `0`.      | Data-rich benchmark remains readable without forced root panning on narrow portrait devices.                                | Preserve mobile-card-first interpretation path for narrow widths and keep desktop tables secondary on mobile.                  | Keep fixture portrait matrix checks for card presence and no-overflow in every benchmark-related PR.    |
| `anim-gate-001`      | core safety gate coverage                   | low      | 0.95       | Cycle-4 introduces blocking workflow `/Users/fabiencampana/Documents/imageforge-site/.github/workflows/animation-safety.yml` plus committed scripts under `/Users/fabiencampana/Documents/imageforge-site/scripts/animation/`. | Regression detection moved from advisory-only to deterministic merge-blocking for overflow/reduced-motion/critical content. | Keep gate scope narrow to core safety; continue advisory reporting for style and density to avoid over-constraining iteration. | Periodically verify workflow runtime and artifact outputs remain stable on PRs and `main`.              |

## Operating Notes

1. Core safety checks are strict (merge-blocking), while style/density findings remain advisory.
2. Runtime evidence for cycle 5 was gathered with:
   - `.tmp/animation/matrix-canonical.json`
   - `.tmp/animation/matrix-fixture.json`
3. Fixture-mode benchmark validation used:
   - `BENCHMARK_ENABLE_LOCAL_FIXTURE=1`
   - `BENCHMARK_SNAPSHOT_FIXTURE=sample`
4. Fix sequencing remains:
   1. user-impact blockers
   2. accessibility/safety risks
   3. SEO discoverability risks
   4. performance regression risks
