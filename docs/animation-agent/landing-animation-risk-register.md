# Landing and Benchmark Animation Risk Register

Date: 2026-02-18
Scope: Landing + benchmark (`/`, `/benchmarks/latest`, `/components/landing/*`, `/components/benchmark/*`)
Status model: Core safety strict in CI (cycle 4) + advisory style scoring

## Usage

- This register tracks animation risks through static review plus runtime viewport/motion verification.
- Core safety checks are now merge-blocking via the animation safety workflow.
- Remaining style/density findings stay advisory.
- Severity and confidence scoring must follow:

| `anim-overflow-001`  | narrow-viewport root overflow               | low      | 0.97       | Cycle-4 canonical and fixture matrices report `overflowLanding=0` and `overflowBenchmark=0` across all 48 checks per run.                                                                                                      | Root-level horizontal drift remains mitigated.                                                                              | Keep overflow clipping/root containment policy and avoid reintroducing root-level horizontal panning surfaces.                 | Keep `documentElement.scrollWidth <= innerWidth` as a blocking CI assertion.                                      |
| `anim-loop-001`      | terminal loop intensity                     | low      | 0.88       | Cycle-4 polish did not change terminal animation model; cursor remains reveal-scoped and suppressed in reduced mode via CSS + JS controls.                                                                                     | Distraction risk remains low.                                                                                               | Preserve current terminal loop constraints and avoid decorative loop expansion.                                                | Verify cursor suppression and reduced-mode behavior in every cycle audit.                                         |
| `anim-timeline-001`  | terminal timeline determinism               | low      | 0.86       | Cycle-4 scope intentionally left `TerminalDemo` logic unchanged; prior deterministic preview-first behavior remains active.                                                                                                    | Timeline complexity risk is unchanged and still low/advisory.                                                               | Keep explicit full-output control discoverable; avoid new timeline branches without dedicated audit evidence.                  | Re-check timeline behavior if terminal reveal logic changes in future cycles.                                     |
| `anim-seo-001`       | interaction-gated visibility risk           | low      | 0.90       | Cycle-4 matrices report `heroClaimMissing=0` and `primaryCtaMissing=0` for all landing cells in canonical + fixture runs.                                                                                                      | Critical claim and CTA discoverability remain safe under animation behavior.                                                | Keep hero claim/CTA in immediate render path and prevent interaction-gated reveal of core indexable content.                   | Preserve hero claim + primary CTA checks in blocking safety script.                                               |

| `anim-benchmark-001` | benchmark entry density (data-rich branch)  | medium   | 0.92       | Cycle-4 fixture matrix (`.tmp/animation/matrix-fixture.json`, `generatedAt=2026-02-18T17:54:56.493Z`) shows benchmark default wrapper average `6.00` (canonical fallback remains `1.00`).                                      | Data-rich benchmark now uses deliberate low-amplitude section reveals; density is still acceptable but requires monitoring. | Keep benchmark reveal cadence subtle, avoid additional stagers, and tune only if readability/perf signals regress.             | Track benchmark default wrapper average after each benchmark-layout change.                                       |
| `anim-benchmark-002` | benchmark narrow-width interaction friction | low      | 0.93       | Cycle-4 fixture portrait checks show stable mobile interpretation surfaces in all sampled cells: delta cards `3` and recent cards `2` for each `320/360/375/390/412` viewport in both motion modes; overflow remains `0`.      | Data-rich benchmark remains readable without forced root panning on narrow portrait devices.                                | Preserve mobile-card-first interpretation path for narrow widths and keep desktop tables secondary on mobile.                  | Keep fixture portrait matrix checks for card presence and no-overflow in every benchmark-related PR.              |
| `anim-gate-001`      | core safety gate coverage                   | low      | 0.95       | Cycle-4 introduces blocking workflow `/Users/fabiencampana/Documents/imageforge-site/.github/workflows/animation-safety.yml` plus committed scripts under `/Users/fabiencampana/Documents/imageforge-site/scripts/animation/`. | Regression detection moved from advisory-only to deterministic merge-blocking for overflow/reduced-motion/critical content. | Keep gate scope narrow to core safety; continue advisory reporting for style and density to avoid over-constraining iteration. | Periodically verify workflow runtime and artifact outputs remain stable on PRs and `main`.                        |

## Operating Notes

1. Core safety checks are now strict (merge-blocking), while style/density findings remain advisory.
2. Runtime evidence for cycle 4 was gathered with:
   - `.tmp/animation/matrix-canonical.json`
   - `.tmp/animation/matrix-fixture.json`
3. Fixture-mode benchmark validation used:
   - `BENCHMARK_ENABLE_LOCAL_FIXTURE=1`
   - `BENCHMARK_SNAPSHOT_FIXTURE=sample`
4. Fix sequencing remains:
   1. user-impact blockers
   2. accessibility/safety risks
   3. SEO discoverability risks
   4. performance regression risks
