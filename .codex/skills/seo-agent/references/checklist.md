# SEO Checklist

## Technical

1. `metadataBase` is present and valid.
2. Canonical alternates are configured.
3. `app/robots.ts` and `app/sitemap.ts` exist and resolve from the same site URL source.
4. Open Graph and Twitter image routes exist and are referenced.
5. Homepage ships required JSON-LD (`WebSite`, `SoftwareApplication`).
6. Internal links resolve to first-party routes.

## Content

1. Title and description are clear, non-duplicative, and length-appropriate.
2. Copy covers core keyword clusters from repo-seeded terms.
3. Section headings map to user intent.
4. Thin-content signals are tracked and reduced over time.

## Off-page

1. Public homepage is reachable and metadata is rendered in HTML.
2. Competitor metadata snapshots are pulled when configured.
3. Backlink opportunity backlog is maintained.

## Optional GSC

1. Credentials are valid and property access works.
2. High-impression / low-CTR queries generate opportunities.
3. GSC gaps are advisory unless explicitly promoted.
