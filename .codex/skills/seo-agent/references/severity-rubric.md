# Severity Rubric

## critical

Blocking technical failures that materially harm crawlability or canonical integrity.
Examples: missing canonical, missing sitemap/robots, unresolved site URL, missing required JSON-LD, broken internal links.

## high

Major quality gaps with strong ranking or CTR impact but not immediate crawl breakage.
Examples: weak title/description quality, poor keyword coverage, missing rel=noopener on external target links.

## medium

Important but non-blocking issues.
Examples: thin content, unreachable competitor snapshots, public metadata partial failures.

## low

Suggestions or optional improvements.
Examples: backlog opportunities, optional off-page enhancements, skipped adapters due missing optional credentials.
